# palia-checklist

Originally, this repo was going to power a checklist for gift giving for the various villagers in [Palia](https://palia.com/) for a given week.

I ended up pausing the project, but this still has some of the code that serves up APIs based on [the official Palia wiki](https://palia.wiki.gg/wiki/Palia_Wiki). It also contains code that is used today to reset each Villager's Weekly Wants in the wiki at the start of each game week (4am UTC Mondays).

**Beware** blindly running the reset function may actually delete data in the wiki.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
1. Ensure node is installed, ideally via nvm (check .nvmrc for the version of node)
1. Ensure `yarn` is installed
1. Run `yarn` from the root directory to install dependencies
