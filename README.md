# palia-checklist

Originally, this repo was going to power a checklist for gift giving for the various villagers in [Palia](https://palia.com/) for a given week.

I ended up pausing the project, but this still has code that is used to reset each Villager's Weekly Wants in the wiki at the start of each game week (4am UTC Mondays).

**Beware** blindly running the reset function may actually delete data in the wiki.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
1. Run `uv sync` to install dependencies and set up a virtual environment
